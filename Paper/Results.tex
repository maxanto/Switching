\section{Results}\label{sec:resultados}
Five pseudo chaotic maps were studied. For each one a floating point representation, a decimal numbers representation with $1\leq P \leq 27$ and a binary numbers representation with $1\leq B \leq 27$ are considered. For each representation $1000$ time series were generated using randomly chosen initial conditions within the interval $[0,1]$. 
The studied maps are tent (TENT), logistic (LOG) a sequential switching between TENT and LOG (SWITCH). Furthermore a skipping randomization procedure is applied to SWITCH \cite{DeMicco2008}, discarding the values in the odd positions (EVEN) or the values in the even positions (ODD) respectively. Let us detail our results for each of these maps.

Here we report our results for both maps:

\input{TentMapResults}

In summary, a comparison between LOG and TENT maps shows that only LOG  can be used because TENT is highly anomalous.
