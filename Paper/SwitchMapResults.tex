\subsubsection{SWITCH} \label{sssec:switch}

Results with sequential switching are shown in Figs. \ref{fig:SWITCH_QuantiB} (a) to (f).
The entropy value calculated for the floating-point implementation is $\left\langle H_{val}\right\rangle =0.9722$, this value is slightly higher than the one obtained for the LOG map. 
For fixed-point arithmetic this value is reached in $B=24$, but it stabilizes from $B=28$.
Regarding the ordering patterns the number of MP decreases to $586$, this value is lower than the one obtained for LOG map.
It means the entropy $H_{BP}$ may increase up to $ln(134)/ln(720)\simeq 0.74$.
BP and BPW quantifiers reach their maximum of $\left\langle H_{BP}\right\rangle =0.6546$ and $\left\langle H_{BPW}\right\rangle =0.6313$ at $B=16$, but they stabilize from $B=24$.
Complexities are lower than for LOG, $\left\langle C_{BP}\right\rangle =0.4580$ and $\left\langle C_{BPW}\right\rangle =0.4578$, these values are reached for $B \geq 15$ but they are stable from $B \geq 23$.
Compared with LOG, statistical properties are better with less amount of bits, for $B \geq 24$ this map reaches optimal characteristics in the sense of random source.

Furthermore, we encountered one initial condition in floating-point long double precision with an anomalous behavior.
Figs. \ref{fig:SWITCH_QuantiB} (a), (b) and (d) show an horizontal blue dashed line that is far from the average value, unlike this is not detected by quantifiers based on $BPW$ procedure in Figs. \ref{fig:SWITCH_QuantiB} (c) and (e).
Nevertheless comparing both procedures ($BP$ and $BPW$) we were able to detect a falling to fixed point after a long transitory, the BPW procedure discards the values corresponding with a fixed point and calculates only the transitory.

Double entropy plane $H_{val}$ vs $H_{BP}$ is showed in Fig. \ref{fig:SWITCH_HH}.
The reached point in this plane for SWITCH map is similar to that reached for LOG map, and it is denoted by a star in the figure.
The mixing is slight better in this case.

Entropy-complexity plane $C_{BP}$ vs $H_{BP}$ is showed in Fig. \ref{fig:SWITCH_HC}.
If we compare with the same plane in the case of LOG (Fig. \ref{fig:LOG_HC}. (a)), $C_{BP}$ is lower for SWITCH, this fact shows a more random behavior.
