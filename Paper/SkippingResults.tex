\subsubsection{Skipping on sequential switching between Tent and Logistic maps (EVEN and ODD)} \label{sssec:skipp}

Skipping is a usual randomizing technique that increases the mixing quality of a single map and correspondingly increases the value of $H_{BP}$ and decreases $C_{BP} $ of the time series.
Skipping does not change the values of $H_{val}$ and $C_{val}$ evaluated using the non causal PDF (normalized histogram)\cite{DeMicco2008}.

In the case under consideration we study Even and Odd skipping of the sequential switching of Tent and Logistic maps.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Even skipping of the sequential switching of Tent and Logistic maps (EVEN).\\
	If $\{x_n,~(n=1,...\infty)\}$ is the time series generated by \ref{eq:seq} discard all the values in odd positions and retain the values in even positions.
	\item Odd skipping of the sequential switching of Tent and Logistica maps.
	If $\{x_n,~(n=1,...\infty)\}$ is the time series generated by \ref{eq:seq} discard all the values in even positions and retain all the values in odd positions.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

The reason for studying even and odd skipping cases is the sequential switching map $M_{switch}$ is the composition of two different maps. Even skipping may be expressed as $M_{TENT}\circ M_{LOG}$ while odd skipping may be expressed as $M_{LOG} \circ M_{TENT}$.

Quantifiers related to the normalized histogram of values slightly degrades with the skipping procedure. For example $H_{val}$ reduces from $0.9722$ without skipping to $0.9459$ for EVEN and $0.9706$ for ODD. 
This difference between EVEN and ODD is because in floating point an high dispersion was obtained for $H_{val}$, $H_{BP}$ and $C_{BP}$ but not for $H_{BPW}$ or $C_{BPW}$.

From the point of view of order patterns a great improvement is obtained using any of the skipping strategies but ODD is slightly better than EVEN.
MP are reduced to $MP\simeq 118$ for EVEN and  ODD, increasing the maximum allowed Bandt \& Pompe entropy that reaches the mean value $<H_{BP}> = 0.8381$ for EVEN, and $<H_{BP}> = 0.9094$.
The complexity is reduced to $<C_{BP}>\simeq 0.224$ for EVEN and  $<C_{BP}>\simeq 0.282$ with for ODD.

As a counterpart, higher accuracy is required to achieve low complexity, characteristic of stochastic systems.
Amount of bits to represent the fractional part was $B>40$ for both EVEN and ODD generators.

In Figs. \ref{fig:EVEN_QuantiB} and Figs. \ref{fig:ODD_QuantiB} are shown the results for EVEN and ODD respsctivelly.
