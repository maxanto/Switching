abstract = {We deal here with the issue of determinism versus randomness in time series. One wishes to identify their relative weights in a given time series. Two different tools have been advanced in the literature to such effect, namely, (i) the "causal" entropycomplexity plane [O.A. Rosso, H.A. Larrondo, M.T. Mart??n, A. Plastino, M.A. Fuentes, Distinguishing noise from chaos, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 (2007) 154102] and (ii) the estimation of the decay rate of missing ordinal patterns [J.M. Amig??, S. Zambrano, M.A.F. Sanju??n, True and false forbidden patterns in deterministic and random dynamics, Europhys. Lett. 79 (2007) 50001; L.C. Carpi, P.M. Saco, O.A. Rosso, Missing ordinal patterns in correlated noises. Physica A 389 (2010) 20202029]. In this work we extend the use of these techniques to address the analysis of deterministic finite time series contaminated with additive noises of different degree of correlation. The chaotic series studied here was via the logistic map (r=4) to which we added correlated noise (colored noise with f-k Power Spectrum, 0???k???2) of varying amplitudes. In such a fashion important insights pertaining to the deterministic component of the original time series can be gained. We find that in the entropycomplexity plane this goal can be achieved without additional computations. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the distinction between white noise and deterministic chaos in multivariate noisy time series. Our method is combinatorial in the sense that it is based on the properties of topological permutation entropy, and it becomes especially interesting when the noise is so high that the standard denoising techniques fail, so a detection of determinism is the most one can hope for. It proceeds by i) counting the number of the so-called ordinal patterns in independent samples of length L from the data sequence and ii) performing a $\chi$2 test based on the results of i), the null hypothesis being that the data are white noise. Holds the null hypothesis, so should all possible ordinal patterns of a given length be visible and evenly distributed over sufficiently many samples, contrarily to what happens in the case of noisy deterministic data. We present numerical evidence in two dimensions for the efficiency of this method. A brief comparison with two common tests for independence, namely, the calculation of the autocorrelation function and the BDS algorithm, is also performed.},

In particular, those possessing a generating partition can produce any symbolic sequence by properly choosing the initial state. We study in this Letter the ability of chaotic maps to generate order patterns and come to the conclusion that their performance in this respect falls short of expectations. This result reveals some basic limitation of a deterministic dynamic as compared to a random one. This being the case, we propose a non-statistical test based on 'forbidden' order patterns to discriminate chaotic from truly random time series with, in principle, arbitrarily high probability.

abstract = {Pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) are extensively used in Monte Carlo simulations, gambling machines and cryptography as substitutes of ideal random number generators (RNG). Each application imposes different statistical requirements to PRNGs. As L'Ecuyer clearly states "the main goal for Monte Carlo methods is to reproduce the statistical properties on which these methods are based whereas for gambling machines and cryptology, observing the sequence of output values for some time should provide no practical advantage for predicting the forthcoming numbers better than by just guessing at random". In accordance with different applications several statistical test suites have been developed to analyze the sequences generated by PRNGs. In a recent paper a new statistical complexity measure [Phys. Lett. A 311 (2003) 126] has been defined. Here we propose this measure, as a randomness quantifier of a PRNGs. The test is applied to three very well known and widely tested PRNGs available in the literature. All of them are based on mathematical algorithms. Another PRNGs based on Lorenz 3D chaotic dynamical system is also analyzed. PRNGs based on chaos may be considered as a model for physical noise sources and important new results are recently reported. All the design steps of this PRNG are described, and each stage increase the PRNG randomness using different strategies. It is shown that the MPR statistical complexity measure is capable to quantify this randomness improvement. The PRNG based on the chaotic 3D Lorenz dynamical system is also evaluated using traditional digital signal processing tools for comparison. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNG) have attracted intense attention due to their obvious importance for many branches of science and technology. A randomizing technique is a procedure designed to improve the PRNG randomness degree according the specific requirements. It is obviously important to quantify its effectiveness. In order to classify randomizing techniques based on a symbolic dynamics' approach, we advance a novel, physically motivated representation based on the statistical properties of chaotic systems. Recourse is made to a plane that has as coordinates (i) the Shannon entropy and (ii) a form of the statistical complexity measure. Each statistical quantifier incorporates a different probability distribution function, generating thus a representation that (i) sheds insight into just how each randomizing technique operates and also (ii) quantifies its effectiveness. Using the Logistic Map and the Three Way Bernoulli Map as typical examples of chaotic dynamics it is shown that our methodology allows for choosing the more convenient randomizing technique in each instance. Comparison with measures of complexity based on diagonal lines on the recurrence plots [N. Marwan, M.C. Romano, M. Thiel, J. Kurths, Phys.

As it turns out, the orbits of one-dimensional maps have always forbidden patterns, i.e., order patterns that cannot occur, in contrast with random time series, in which any order pattern appears with probability one. However, finite random sequences may exhibit “false” forbidden patterns with non-vanishing probability. In this case, forbidden patterns decay with the sequence length, thus unveiling the random nature of the sequence. Last but not least, true forbidden patterns are robust against noise and disintegrate with a rate that depends on the noise level. These properties can be embodied in a simple method to distinguish deterministic, finite time series with very high levels of observational noise, from random ones. We present numerical evidence for white noise.},

abstract = {A deterministic overdamped ratchet driven by a periodic square driving force is shown to display chaotic behavior. The system has neither temporal nor quenched noise but the strong nonlinearity of the driving force produces a very rich bifurcation pattern with synchronized as well as chaotic regions. This pattern disappears if a sinusoidal force replaces the square force. This unexpected behavior is explained by decomposing the system into two exactly solvable subsystems, each with its own characteristic transit time, so that the ratio between the period of the driving force and the transit times can be analyzed. The transition from synchronized to chaotic motion can be explained by means of a one-dimensional Poincar{\'{e}} map. Our results can be experimentally confirmed in a number of systems, including the three-junction superconducting quantum interference devices ratchet, the rocking ratchet effect for cold atoms, and the Josephson vortex ratchet.},

abstract = {We deal with randomness quantifiers and concentrate on their ability to discern the hallmark of chaos in time series used in connection with pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). Workers in the field are motivated to use chaotic maps for generating PRNGs because of the simplicity of their implementation. Although there exist very efficient general-purpose benchmarks for testing PRNGs, we feel that the analysis provided here sheds additional didactic light on the importance of the main statistical characteristics of a chaotic map, namely (i) its invariant measure and (ii) the mixing constant. This is of help in answering two questions that arise in applications: (i) which is the best PRNG among the available ones? and (ii) if a given PRNG turns out not to be good enough and a randomization procedure must still be applied to it, which is the best applicable randomization procedure? Our answer provides a comparative analysis of several quantifiers advanced in the extant literature.},

abstract = {We analyze the statistical complexity measure vs. entropy plane-representation of sampled chaotic attractors as a function of the sampling period $\tau$ and show that, if the Bandt and Pompe procedure is used to assign a probability distribution function (PDF) to the pertinent time series, the statistical complexity measure (SCM) attains a definite maximum for a specific sampling period tM. On the contrary, the usual histogram approach for assigning PDFs to a time series leads to essentially constant SCM values for any sampling period $\tau$. The significance of tM is further investigated by comparing it with typical times found in the literature for the two main reconstruction processes: the Takens' one in a delay-time embedding, on one hand, and the exact NyquistShannon reconstruction, on the other one. It is shown that tM is compatible with those times recommended as adequate delay ones in Takens' reconstruction. The reported results correspond to three representative chaotic systems having correlation dimension 2{\textless} D2{\textless}3. One recent experiment confirms the analysis presented here. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

On the basis of counting ordinal patterns, which describe the up-and-down in a time series, they have introduced the concept of permutation entropy for quantifying the complexity of a system behind a time series. The permutation entropy only provides one detail of the ordinal structure of a time series. Here we present a method for extracting the whole ordinal information. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ring oscillators (RO's) are elementary blocks widely used in digital design. Jitter is unavoidable in RO's, its presence is an undesired behavior in many applications, as clock generators. On the contrary, jitter may be used as the noise source in RO-based true-random numbers generators (TRNG). Consequently, jitter measure is a relevant issue to characterize a RO, and it is the subject of this paper. The main contribution is the use of Information Theory Quantifiers (ITQ) as measures of RO's jitter. It is shown that among several ITQ evaluated, two of them emerge as good measures because they are independent of parameters used for their statistical determination. They turned out to be robust and may be implemented experimentally. We encountered that a dual entropy plane allows a visual comparison of results.},
