abstract = {This book gives a unified treatment of a variety of mathematical systems generating densities, ranging from one-dimensional discrete time transformations through continuous time systems described by integro-partial-differential equations. Examples have been drawn from a variety of the sciences to illustrate the utility of the techniques presented. This material was organized and written to be accessible to scientists with knowledge of advanced calculus and differential equations. In various concepts from measure theory, ergodic theory, the geometry of manifolds, partial differential equations, probability theory and Markov processes, and chastic integrals and differential equations are introduced. The past few years have witnessed an explosive growth in interest in physical, biological, and economic systems that could be profitably studied using densities. Due to the general inaccessibility of the mathematical literature to the non-mathematician, there has been little diffusion of the concepts and techniques from ergodic theory into the study of these "chaotic" systems. This book intends to bridge that gap.},

abstract = {Intrinsic computation refers to how dynamical systems store, structure, and transform historical and spatial information. By graphing a measure of structural complexity against a measure of randomness, complexity-entropy diagrams display the different kinds of intrinsic computation across an entire class of systems. Here, we use complexity-entropy diagrams to analyze intrinsic computation in a broad array of deterministic nonlinear and linear stochastic processes, including maps of the interval, cellular automata, and Ising spin systems in one and two dimensions, Markov chains, and probabilistic minimal finite-state machines. Since complexity-entropy diagrams are a function only of observed configurations, they can be used to compare systems without reference to system coordinates or parameters. It has been known for some time that in special cases complexity-entropy diagrams reveal that high degrees of information processing are associated with phase transitions in the underlying process space, the so-called "edge of chaos." Generally, though, complexity-entropy diagrams differ substantially in character, demonstrating a genuine diversity of distinct kinds of intrinsic computation.},

EPI is an expression of the imperfection of observation: Owing to random interaction of a subject with its observer and other possible disturbances, its measurement contains less Fisher information than does the subject per se. Moreover, the information loss is an extreme value. An EPI output may alternatively be viewed as the payoff of a zero-sum game of information acquisition between the observer and a 'demon' in subject space. EPI derives, Escher-like, the very probability law that gave rise to the measurement. In applications, EPI is used to derive both existing and new analytical relations governing probability laws of physics, genetics, cancer growth, ecology and economics. This unified approach will be fascinating to students and those who seek a new mathematical tool of research.},

abstract = {Data analysis and model-data comparisons in the environmental sciences require diagnos-tic measures that quantify time series dynamics and structure, and are robust to noise in observational data. This paper investigates the temporal dynamics of environmental time series using measures quantifying their information content and complexity. The measures are used to classify natural processes on one hand, and to compare models with observa-tions on the other. The present analysis focuses on the global carbon cycle as an area of research in which model-data integration and comparisons are key to improving our under-standing of natural phenomena. We investigate the dynamics of observed and simulated time series of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), a key variable in terrestrial ecosystems that quantifies ecosystem carbon uptake. However, the dynamics, patterns and magni-tudes of GPP time series, both observed and simulated, vary substantially on different tem-poral and spatial scales. We demonstrate here that information content and complexity, or Information Theory Quantifiers (ITQ) for short, serve as robust and efficient data-analytical and model benchmarking tools for evaluating the temporal structure and dynamical proper-ties of simulated or observed time series at various spatial scales. At continental scale, we compare GPP time series simulated with two models and an observations-based product. This analysis reveals qualitative differences between model evaluation based on ITQ com-pared to traditional model performance metrics, indicating that good model performance in terms of absolute or relative error does not imply that the dynamics of the observations is captured well. Furthermore, we show, using an ensemble of site-scale measurements obtained from the FLUXNET archive in the Mediterranean, that model-data or model-model mismatches as indicated by ITQ can be attributed to and interpreted as differences in the temporal structure of the respective ecological time series.

On the other hand, commonly used strategies to avoid the parasitic equilibria onset also affect the uniformity of the probability density function.

Consequently, jitter measure is a relevant issue to characterize a RO, and it is the subject of this paper. The main contribution is the use of Information Theory Quantifiers (ITQ) as measures of RO's jitter. It is shown that among several ITQ evaluated, two of them emerge as good measures because they are independent of parameters used for their statistical determination.

abstract = {This paper deals with the distinction between white noise and deterministic chaos in multivariate noisy time series. Our method is combinatorial in the sense that it is based on the properties of topological permutation entropy, and it becomes especially interesting when the noise is so high that the standard denoising techniques fail, so a detection of determinism is the most one can hope for. It proceeds by i) counting the number of the so-called ordinal patterns in independent samples of length L from the data sequence and ii) performing a $\chi$2 test based on the results of i), the null hypothesis being that the data are white noise. Holds the null hypothesis, so should all possible ordinal patterns of a given length be visible and evenly distributed over sufficiently many samples, contrarily to what happens in the case of noisy deterministic data. We present numerical evidence in two dimensions for the efficiency of this method. A brief comparison with two common tests for independence, namely, the calculation of the autocorrelation function and the BDS algorithm, is also performed.},

abstract = {Pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) are extensively used in Monte Carlo simulations, gambling machines and cryptography as substitutes of ideal random number generators (RNG). Each application imposes different statistical requirements to PRNGs. As L'Ecuyer clearly states "the main goal for Monte Carlo methods is to reproduce the statistical properties on which these methods are based whereas for gambling machines and cryptology, observing the sequence of output values for some time should provide no practical advantage for predicting the forthcoming numbers better than by just guessing at random". In accordance with different applications several statistical test suites have been developed to analyze the sequences generated by PRNGs. In a recent paper a new statistical complexity measure [Phys. Lett. A 311 (2003) 126] has been defined. Here we propose this measure, as a randomness quantifier of a PRNGs. The test is applied to three very well known and widely tested PRNGs available in the literature. All of them are based on mathematical algorithms. Another PRNGs based on Lorenz 3D chaotic dynamical system is also analyzed. PRNGs based on chaos may be considered as a model for physical noise sources and important new results are recently reported. All the design steps of this PRNG are described, and each stage increase the PRNG randomness using different strategies. It is shown that the MPR statistical complexity measure is capable to quantify this randomness improvement. The PRNG based on the chaotic 3D Lorenz dynamical system is also evaluated using traditional digital signal processing tools for comparison. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

As it turns out, the orbits of one-dimensional maps have always forbidden patterns, i.e., order patterns that cannot occur, in contrast with random time series, in which any order pattern appears with probability one. However, finite random sequences may exhibit “false” forbidden patterns with non-vanishing probability. In this case, forbidden patterns decay with the sequence length, thus unveiling the random nature of the sequence. Last but not least, true forbidden patterns are robust against noise and disintegrate with a rate that depends on the noise level. These properties can be embodied in a simple method to distinguish deterministic, finite time series with very high levels of observational noise, from random ones.

On the contrary, the usual histogram approach for assigning PDFs to a time series leads to essentially constant SCM values for any sampling period $\tau$. The significance of tM is further investigated by comparing it with typical times found in the literature for the two main reconstruction processes: the Takens' one in a delay-time embedding, on one hand, and the exact NyquistShannon reconstruction, on the other one. It is shown that tM is compatible with those times recommended as adequate delay ones in Takens' reconstruction.

abstract = {Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNG) have attracted intense attention due to their obvious importance for many branches of science and technology. A randomizing technique is a procedure designed to improve the PRNG randomness degree according the specific requirements. It is obviously important to quantify its effectiveness. In order to classify randomizing techniques based on a symbolic dynamics' approach, we advance a novel, physically motivated representation based on the statistical properties of chaotic systems. Recourse is made to a plane that has as coordinates (i) the Shannon entropy and (ii) a form of the statistical complexity measure. Each statistical quantifier incorporates a different probability distribution function, generating thus a representation that (i) sheds insight into just how each randomizing technique operates and also (ii) quantifies its effectiveness. Using the Logistic Map and the Three Way Bernoulli Map as typical examples of chaotic dynamics it is shown that our methodology allows for choosing the more convenient randomizing technique in each instance. Comparison with measures of complexity based on diagonal lines on the recurrence plots [N. Marwan, M.C. Romano, M. Thiel, J. Kurths, Phys.

Although there exist very efficient general-purpose benchmarks for testing PRNGs, we feel that the analysis provided here sheds additional didactic light on the importance of the main statistical characteristics of a chaotic map, namely (i) its invariant measure and (ii) the mixing constant. This is of help in answering two questions that arise in applications: (i) which is the best PRNG among the available ones? and (ii) if a given PRNG turns out not to be good enough and a randomization procedure must still be applied to it, which is the best applicable randomization procedure? Our answer provides a comparative analysis of several quantifiers advanced in the extant literature.},

@article{Zarlenga2009,
abstract = {A deterministic overdamped ratchet driven by a periodic square driving force is shown to display chaotic behavior. The system has neither temporal nor quenched noise but the strong nonlinearity of the driving force produces a very rich bifurcation pattern with synchronized as well as chaotic regions. This pattern disappears if a sinusoidal force replaces the square force. This unexpected behavior is explained by decomposing the system into two exactly solvable subsystems, each with its own characteristic transit time, so that the ratio between the period of the driving force and the transit times can be analyzed. The transition from synchronized to chaotic motion can be explained by means of a one-dimensional Poincar{\'{e}} map. Our results can be experimentally confirmed in a number of systems, including the three-junction superconducting quantum interference devices ratchet, the rocking ratchet effect for cold atoms, and the Josephson vortex ratchet.},

The expected period, probability distribution of periods, and expected number of periodic orbits are investigated for the case of fractal chaotic attractors.
