	abstract={In this work the digital implementation of a chaotic system onto a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), is analyzed. Any digital implementation requires the choice of an algorithm to discretize time and a representation standard to represent real numbers. Each choice modifies the stochasticity degree of the system and also defines a different amount of resources on the FPGA. The main contribution of this paper is to study this issue, by comparing different realizations of the same chaotic system. An optimum design methodology for applications in which the chaotic system is going to replace a stochastic system is also reported. This is the case with PRNGs. The stochasticity degree must be measured. In this paper we use the global indicator proposed by Marsaglia in his widely used DIEHARD tests-suite. Results are exemplified for the Lorenz chaotic oscillator but the same methodology may be used with other low dimensional chaotic systems.},

abstract = {This article shows the presence of Moir{\'{e}} Interference patterns in the map of periods of the Mandelbrot Set. It describes the requirements for their appearance and shows that such interferences are highly sensitive to the original conditions that define their calculation. The specific case herein studied shows that the Moir{\'{e}} interference patterns appearing in a picture of a section of the map of orbits are unpredictable, even if we obtain different maps from very similar original conditions. It begins with a brief description of the Mandelbrot Set and some of the characteristics of its orbits, the Moir{\'{e}} Patterns, as well as a concise introduction to a description of the Discrete Wavelet Transform. In order to develop the proposed specific case, a Multi-resolution Analysis method based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform has been used. It is significant that Moir{\'{e}} Interference Patterns always appear when the order of magnitudes reaches a certain limit where, what is considered as hypothetically continuous, behaves as a discrete pattern. The patterns as shown by the Wavelet analysis change drastically at the slightest modification in the original calculation conditions and it does not seem possible to predict their shape beforehand. This article ends with some conclusions and suggestions.},

Is it possible to infer from this observed correlation that the cause of these interferences can be found in the truncation errors in the floating-point data type? Is Moire a consequence of the discretization in the pixel computation from the picture of the orbit map? Does Moir{\'{e}} appear sooner or later depending on the arithmetic precision considered? Would Moir{\'{e}} show up if the calculations were done by any technology allowing infinite precision?

If we work with changeable-precision data types, we can vary the moment in which Moir{\'{e}} interference patterns appear,
but we won't be able to prevent them in any case. Regardless of the extension of the mantissas and exponents of our representations, we will always be working with limited precision values.},

Our method is combinatorial in the sense that it is based on the properties of topological permutation entropy, and it becomes especially interesting when the noise is so high that the standard denoising techniques fail, so a detection of determinism is the most one can hope for. It proceeds by i) counting the number of the so-called ordinal patterns in independent samples of length L from the data sequence and ii) performing a $\chi$2 test based on the results of i), the null hypothesis being that the data are white noise. Holds the null hypothesis, so should all possible ordinal patterns of a given length be visible and evenly distributed over sufficiently many samples, contrarily to what happens in the case of noisy deterministic data. We present numerical evidence in two dimensions for the efficiency of this method. A brief comparison with two common tests for independence, namely, the calculation of the autocorrelation function and the BDS algorithm, is also performed.},

In particular, those possessing a generating partition can produce any symbolic sequence by properly choosing the initial state. We study in this Letter the ability of chaotic maps to generate order patterns and come to the conclusion that their performance in this respect falls short of expectations. This result reveals some basic limitation of a deterministic dynamic as compared to a random one. This being the case, we propose a non-statistical test based on 'forbidden' order patterns to discriminate chaotic from truly random time series with, in principle, arbitrarily high probability.

As it turns out, the orbits of one-dimensional maps have always forbidden patterns, i.e., order patterns that cannot occur, in contrast with random time series, in which any order pattern appears with probability one. However, finite random sequences may exhibit “false” forbidden patterns with non-vanishing probability. In this case, forbidden patterns decay with the sequence length, thus unveiling the random nature of the sequence. Last but not least, true forbidden patterns are robust against noise and disintegrate with a rate that depends on the noise level. These properties can be embodied in a simple method to distinguish deterministic, finite time series with very high levels of observational noise, from random ones.

On the contrary, jitter may be used as the noise source in RO-based true-random numbers generators (TRNG). Consequently, jitter measure is a relevant issue to characterize a RO, and it is the subject of this paper. The main contribution is the use of Information Theory Quantifiers (ITQ) as measures of RO's jitter. It is shown that among several ITQ evaluated, two of them emerge as good measures because they are independent of parameters used for their statistical determination. They turned out to be robust and may be implemented experimentally. We encountered that a dual entropy plane allows a visual comparison of results.},

annote = {However, the hardware realization of these sequence generators with good statistical properties is still a great challenge. Furthermore, when chaotic generators are implemented in a digital form with finite precision, it is doubtful whether or not they can still preserve the desired dynamics of the chaotic systems since most dynamical properties of chaos are mean- ingful only when dynamical systems evolve in the continuous phase space. These properties may become ambiguous when the phase space is forcedly digitized with a finite computing precision[17–19].

Hence, to design an efficient digital chaotic cipher, the following most essential drawbacks of the chaotic systems must be considered: (i) weak resistance to recovery of parameters, (ii) lower digital precision comparing to the analog generators, (iii) periodicity problems, (iv) non-ideal probability distributions and (v) higher level of correlation with a bad trade-off cost, per- formance and power consumption.

The continuous chaotic system disturbs the discrete chaotic system in order to eliminate the peri- odicity owing to the finite precision. In addition, this system is also used to achieve synchronization between the master HDCCS and the slave one.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design of a modified tent map characterized by a uniform probability density function. The use of this map is proposed as an alternative to the tent map and the Bernoulli shift. It is shown that practical circuits implementing the latter two maps may possess parasitic stable equilibria, fact which would prevent the desired chaotic behavior of the system. On the other hand, commonly used strategies to avoid the parasitic equilibria onset also affect the uniformity of the probability density function. Conversely, the use of the proposed tailed tent map allows to assure a certain degree of parameter deviation robustness, without compromising on the statistical properties of the system.},

abstract = {The paper explores the effect of random parameter switching in a fractional order (FO) unified chaotic system which captures the dynamics of three popular sub-classes of chaotic systems i.e. Lorenz, Lu and Chen's family of attractors. The disappearance of chaos in such systems which rapidly switch from one family to the other has been investigated here for the commensurate FO scenario. Our simulation study show that a noise-like random variation in the key parameter of the unified chaotic system along with a gradual decrease in the commensurate FO is capable of suppressing the chaotic fluctuations much earlier than that with the fixed parameter one. The chaotic time series produced by such random parameter switching in nonlinear dynamical systems have been characterized using the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and Shannon entropy. The effect of choosing different simulation techniques for random parameter FO switched chaotic systems have also been explored through two frequency domain and three time domain methods. Such a noise-like random switching mechanism could be useful for stabilization and control of chaotic oscillation in many real-world applications.},

abstract = {Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNG) have attracted intense attention due to their obvious importance for many branches of science and technology. A randomizing technique is a procedure designed to improve the PRNG randomness degree according the specific requirements. It is obviously important to quantify its effectiveness. In order to classify randomizing techniques based on a symbolic dynamics' approach, we advance a novel, physically motivated representation based on the statistical properties of chaotic systems. Recourse is made to a plane that has as coordinates (i) the Shannon entropy and (ii) a form of the statistical complexity measure. Each statistical quantifier incorporates a different probability distribution function, generating thus a representation that (i) sheds insight into just how each randomizing technique operates and also (ii) quantifies its effectiveness. Using the Logistic Map and the Three Way Bernoulli Map as typical examples of chaotic dynamics it is shown that our methodology allows for choosing the more convenient randomizing technique in each instance. Comparison with measures of complexity based on diagonal lines on the recurrence plots [N. Marwan, M.C. Romano, M. Thiel, J. Kurths, Phys.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd This paper deals with a family of interesting 2D-quadratic maps proposed by Sprott, in his seminal paper [1], related to “chaotic art”. Our main interest about these maps is their great potential for using them in digital electronic applications because they present multiple chaotic attractors depending on the selected point in the parameter's space. Only results for the analytical representation of these maps have been published in the open literature. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to extend the analysis to the digital version, to make possible the hardware implementation in a digital medium, like field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) in fixed-point arithmetic. Our main contributions are: (a) the study of the domains of attraction in fixed-point arithmetic, in terms of period lengths and statistical properties; (b) the determination of the threshold of the bus width that preserves the integrity of the domain of attraction and (c) the comparison between two quantifiers based on respective probability distribution functions (PDFs) and the well known maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) to detect the above mentioned threshold.},

On the contrary, the usual histogram approach for assigning PDFs to a time series leads to essentially constant SCM values for any sampling period $\tau$.

By graphing a measure of structural complexity against a measure of randomness, complexity-entropy diagrams display the different kinds of intrinsic computation across an entire class of systems. Here, we use complexity-entropy diagrams to analyze intrinsic computation in a broad array of deterministic nonlinear and linear stochastic processes, including maps of the interval, cellular automata, and Ising spin systems in one and two dimensions, Markov chains, and probabilistic minimal finite-state machines. Since complexity-entropy diagrams are a function only of observed configurations, they can be used to compare systems without reference to system coordinates or parameters. It has been known for some time that in special cases complexity-entropy diagrams reveal that high degrees of information processing are associated with phase transitions in the underlying process space, the so-called "edge of chaos." Generally, though, complexity-entropy diagrams differ substantially in character, demonstrating a genuine diversity of distinct kinds of intrinsic computation.},

We examine some properties of CLMC and find that it is neither an intensive nor an extensive thermodynamic variable and that it vanishes exponentially in the thermodynamic limit for all one-dimensional finite-range spin systems. We propose a simple alteration of CLMC that renders it extensive. However, this remedy results in a quantity that is a trivial function of the entropy density and hence of no use as a measure of structure or memory. We conclude by suggesting that a useful “statistical complexity” must not only obey the ordered-random boundary conditions of vanishing, it must also be defined in a setting that gives a clear interpretation to what structures are quantified.},

Moreover, the information loss is an extreme value. An EPI output may alternatively be viewed as the payoff of a zero-sum game of information acquisition between the observer and a 'demon' in subject space. EPI derives, Escher-like, the very probability law that gave rise to the measurement. In applications, EPI is used to derive both existing and new analytical relations governing probability laws of physics, genetics, cancer growth, ecology and economics.

In accordance with different applications several statistical test suites have been developed to analyze the sequences generated by PRNGs. In a recent paper a new statistical complexity measure [Phys. Lett. A 311 (2003) 126] has been defined. Here we propose this measure, as a randomness quantifier of a PRNGs. The test is applied to three very well known and widely tested PRNGs available in the literature. All of them are based on mathematical algorithms. Another PRNGs based on Lorenz 3D chaotic dynamical system is also analyzed. PRNGs based on chaos may be considered as a model for physical noise sources and important new results are recently reported. All the design steps of this PRNG are described, and each stage increase the PRNG randomness using different strategies. It is shown that the MPR statistical complexity measure is capable to quantify this randomness improvement.

" Positive Lyapunov exponents " can and do result if an infinitesimal perturbation breaking a perfect two-dimensional antisymmetry is introduced so that the motion expands into a four-dimensional phase space. In that extended space a positive exponent results. We formulate a standard initial condition for the investigation of the microcanonical chaotic number dependence of the model.

abstract = {We discuss a way of characterizing probability distributions, complementing that provided by the celebrated notion of information measure, with reference to a measure of complexity that we call a "nontriviality measure". Our starting point is the "LMC" measure of complexity advanced by L??pez-Ruiz et al. (Phys. Lett. A 209 (1995) 321) and its analysis by Anteneodo and Plastino (Phys. Lett. A 223 (1997) 348). An improvement of some of their troublesome characteristics is thereby achieved. Basically, we replace the Euclidean distance to equilibrium by the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The resulting measure turns out to be (i) an intensive quantity and (ii) allows one to distinguish between different degrees of periodicity. We apply the "cured" measure to the logistic map so as to clearly exhibit its advantages. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This material was organized and written to be accessible to scientists with knowledge of advanced calculus and differential equations. In various concepts from measure theory, ergodic theory, the geometry of manifolds, partial differential equations, probability theory and Markov processes, and chastic integrals and differential equations are introduced. The past few years have witnessed an explosive growth in interest in physical, biological, and economic systems that could be profitably studied using densities. Due to the general inaccessibility of the mathematical literature to the non-mathematician, there has been little diffusion of the concepts and techniques from ergodic theory into the study of these "chaotic" systems.

abstract = {In this paper, an extremely accurate numerical algorithm, namely the "clean numerical simulation" (CNS), is proposed to accurately simulate the propagation of micro-level inherent physical uncertainty of chaotic dynamic systems. The chaotic Hamiltonian H??non-Heiles system for motion of stars orbiting in a plane about the galactic center is used as an example to show its basic ideas and validity. Based on Taylor expansion at rather high-order and MP (multiple precision) data in very high accuracy, the CNS approach can provide reliable trajectories of the chaotic system in a finite interval t ??? [0, Tc], together with an explicit estimation of the critical time T c. Besides, the residual and round-off errors are verified and estimated carefully by means of different time-step ??t, different precision of data, and different order M of Taylor expansion. In this way, the numerical noises of the CNS can be reduced to a required level, i.e. the CNS is a rigorous algorithm. It is illustrated that, for the considered problem, the truncation and round-off errors of the CNS can be reduced even to the level of 10-1244 and 10-1000, respectively, so that the micro-level inherent physical uncertainty of the initial condition (in the level of 10 -60) of the H??non-Heiles system can be investigated accurately. It is found that, due to the sensitive dependence on initial condition (SDIC) of chaos, the micro-level inherent physical uncertainty of the position and velocity of a star transfers into the macroscopic randomness of motion. Thus, chaos might be a bridge from the micro-level inherent physical uncertainty to the macroscopic randomness in nature. This might provide us a new explanation to the SDIC of chaos from the physical viewpoint. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this work, we devise a chaos-based secret key cryptography scheme for digital communication where the encryption is realized at the physical level, that is, the encrypting transformations are applied to the wave signal instead to the symbolic sequence. The encryption process consists of transformations applied to a two-dimensional signal composed of the message carrying signal and an encrypting signal that has to be a chaotic one. The secret key, in this case, is related to the number of times the transformations are applied. Furthermore, we show that due to its chaotic nature, the encrypting signal is able to hide the statistics of the original signal. In this letter, we present a chaos-based cryptography scheme designed for digital communication. We depart from the traditional approach where encrypting transformations are applied to the binary sequence (the symbolic sequence) into which the wave signal is encoded [1]. In this work, we devise a scheme where the encryption is realized at the physical level, that is, a scheme that encrypts the wave signal itself. Our chaos-based cryptographic scheme takes advantage of the complexity of a chaotic transformation. This com-plexity is very desirable for cryptographic schemes, since security increases with the number of possibilities of encryption for a given text unit (a letter for example). One advantage of using a chaotic transformation is that it can be implemented at the physical level by means of a low power deterministic electronic circuit which can be easily etched on a chip. Another advantage is that, contrary to a stochastic transformation, a chaotic one allows an straightforward decryption. Moreover, as has been shown elsewhere [2], chaotic transformations for cryptography, enables one to introduce powerful analytical methods to analyze the method performance, besides satisfying the design axioms that guarantees security. In order to clarify our goal and the scheme devised, in what follows, we initially outline the basic ideas of our method. Given a message represented by a sequence fy},

This manuscript explores the consequences finite precision has on the periodicity of a PRNG based on the logistic map. A comparison is made with conventional methods of generating pseudorandom numbers. The approach used to determine the number, delay, and period of the orbits of the logistic map at varying degrees of precision (3 to 23 bits) is described in detail, including the use of the Condor high-throughput computing environment to parallelize independent tasks of analyzing a large initial seed space. Results demonstrate that in terms of pathological seeds and effective bit length, a PRNG based on the logistic map performs exponentially worse than conventional PRNGs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We review here several fundamental issues in such a respect, namely, a) the selection of the information measure I; (b) the choice of the probability metric space and associated distance D; c) the question of de. ning the so-called generalized disequilibrium Q; (d) the adequate way of picking up the probability distribution P associated to a dynamical system or time series under study, which is indeed a fundamental problem. In this communication we show (point d) that sensible improvements in the final results can be expected if the underlying probability distribution is "extracted" via appropriate consideration regarding causal effects in the system's dynamics.},

abstract = {We present a new approach for handwritten signature classification and verification based on descriptors stemming from time causal information theory. The proposal uses the Shannon entropy, the statistical complexity, and the Fisher information evaluated over the Bandt and Pompe symbolization of the horizontal and vertical coordinates of signatures. These six features are easy and fast to compute, and they are the input to an One-Class Support Vector Machine classifier. The results are better than state-of-the-art online techniques that employ higher-dimensional feature spaces which often require specialized software and hardware. We assess the consistency of our proposal with respect to the size of the training sample, and we also use it to classify the signatures into meaningful groups.},

abstract = {Data analysis and model-data comparisons in the environmental sciences require diagnos-tic measures that quantify time series dynamics and structure, and are robust to noise in observational data. This paper investigates the temporal dynamics of environmental time series using measures quantifying their information content and complexity. The measures are used to classify natural processes on one hand, and to compare models with observa-tions on the other. The present analysis focuses on the global carbon cycle as an area of research in which model-data integration and comparisons are key to improving our under-standing of natural phenomena. We investigate the dynamics of observed and simulated time series of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), a key variable in terrestrial ecosystems that quantifies ecosystem carbon uptake. However, the dynamics, patterns and magni-tudes of GPP time series, both observed and simulated, vary substantially on different tem-poral and spatial scales. We demonstrate here that information content and complexity, or Information Theory Quantifiers (ITQ) for short, serve as robust and efficient data-analytical and model benchmarking tools for evaluating the temporal structure and dynamical proper-ties of simulated or observed time series at various spatial scales. At continental scale, we compare GPP time series simulated with two models and an observations-based product. This analysis reveals qualitative differences between model evaluation based on ITQ com-pared to traditional model performance metrics, indicating that good model performance in terms of absolute or relative error does not imply that the dynamics of the observations is captured well. Furthermore, we show, using an ensemble of site-scale measurements obtained from the FLUXNET archive in the Mediterranean, that model-data or model-model mismatches as indicated by ITQ can be attributed to and interpreted as differences in the temporal structure of the respective ecological time series.

abstract = {A deterministic overdamped ratchet driven by a periodic square driving force is shown to display chaotic behavior. The system has neither temporal nor quenched noise but the strong nonlinearity of the driving force produces a very rich bifurcation pattern with synchronized as well as chaotic regions. This pattern disappears if a sinusoidal force replaces the square force. This unexpected behavior is explained by decomposing the system into two exactly solvable subsystems, each with its own characteristic transit time, so that the ratio between the period of the driving force and the transit times can be analyzed. The transition from synchronized to chaotic motion can be explained by means of a one-dimensional Poincar{\'{e}} map. Our results can be experimentally confirmed in a number of systems, including the three-junction superconducting quantum interference devices ratchet, the rocking ratchet effect for cold atoms, and the Josephson vortex ratchet.},
