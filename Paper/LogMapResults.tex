\subsubsection{Logistic map (LOG)} \label{subsubsec:log}

Logistic map is interesting because is representative of the very large family of quadratic maps.
Its expression is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logimap}
 x_{[n+1]}=4x_{[n]}(1-x_{[n]}) \,
\end{equation}
with $x_n\in\mathcal{R}$.

Note that to effectively work in a given representation it is necessary to change the expression of the map in order to make all the operations in the chosen representation numbers. For example, in the case of LOG the expression in binary fixed point numbers is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logimapB2}
x_{n+1}=4 \epsilon floor\{\frac{x_n(1-x_n)}{\epsilon}\} \,
\end{equation}
with $\epsilon = 2^B$ where $B$ is the number of bits that represents the fractional part.

According as B grows, statistical properties varies until they stabilize.
Figs. \ref{fig:LOG_QuantiB} (a) to (f) show the statistical properties of LOG map in floating point and fixed point representation.
All these figures show: $100$ red points for each fixed point precision ($B$) and in black their average (dashed black line connecting black dots), $100$ horizontal dashed blue lines that are the results of each run in floating point and a black solid line their average.
In this case, all the lines of the floating point are overlapped.

For $B\geq 30$ the value of $H_{val}$ remains almost identical to the values for the floating point representation whereas $H_{BP}$ and $C_{BP}$ stabilizes at $B>21$.
Their values are: $<H_{val}>=0.9669$; $<H_{BP}>=0.6269$; $<C_{BP}>=0.4843$.
Note that the stable value of missing patterns $MP=645$ makes the optimum $H_{BP} \leq ln(75)/ln(720) \simeq 0.65$.
Then $B=30$ is the most convenient choice because an increase in the number of fractional digits does not improve the statistical properties.

Some conclusions can be drawn regarding \textit{BP} and \textit{BPW} quantifiers.

For $B=1, 2, 3$ and $4$, the averaged $BP$ quantifiers are almost $0$ while the averaged $BPW$ quantifiers can not be calculated (seein Figs. \ref{fig:LOG_QuantiB} c and e the missing black dashed line).
For those sequences where the initial condition where $0$ all iterations result to be a sequence of $0$s (the fixed point of the map), this happens very likely with small presitions because of the roundoffs.

For $B=7, 9$ and $12$, a high dispersion in $BPW$ are showed, but not in $BP$ graphs, atractor falls to a fixed point with an short transitory in these cases.

\textcolor{red}{ESTA ORACIÃ“N VA A DESAPARECER CON LONG DOUBLE, O NO?}
Finally, for $B = 45, 49, 51$ and $52$ some $BP$ quantifiers have a low value, but $BPW$ quantifiers have a more predictible behavior, we can see that these atractors fall to a fixed point with a long transitory.
In this behaviour is due to the employed plataform.
The operation miltiplication needs the double of bits to be represented but the machine has only $64$.

In Fig. \ref{fig:LOG_HH} double entropy planes are showed.
Red points are each individual measurement and black points their mean.
Black dashed line shows the evolution of the mean as $B$ growths.
Blue points shows each individual measurement in floating point and their mean with an star.

Although the distribution of values reaches high values their mixing is poor, this can be seen in the evolution of the mean values according $B$ growths.
Accross $B=20$, $H_{val}$ improves but $H_{BP}$ stay around its maximum.

In Fig. \ref{fig:LOG_HC} we shows the entropy-complexity planes.
Dotted gray lines are the upper and lower margins, is spected that an chaotic system remain near upper margin.
There results characterize an chaotic behaviour, in $H_{BP}-C_{BP}$ plane we can see a low entropy and high complexity.
