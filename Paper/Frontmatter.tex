\begin{abstract}

In this paper we investigate the degradation of the statistic properties of chaotic maps as consequence of their implementation in a digital media such as Digital Signal Processors (DSP), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC).

In these systems, binary floating- and fixed-point are the numerical representations available.
Fixed-point representation is preferred over floating-point when speed, low power and/or small circuit area are necessary.
Then, in this paper we compare the degradation of fixed-point binary precision version of chaotic maps with the floating point IEEE754 to evaluate the feasibility of their FPGA implementation.

The specific period that every fixed-point precision produces was investigated in previous reports, using as example the tent map and the logistic map.
Statistical characteristics are also relevant.
It has been recently shown that it is convenient to describe the statistical characteristic using both, causal and non-causal quantifiers.
In this paper we complement the period analysis by characterizing the behavior of these maps from an statistical point of view using causal and non-causal entropies and complexities.
Here we do not look for the system to be similar to the implemented in real numbers, but that certain conditions related to the statistics of systems are met.
